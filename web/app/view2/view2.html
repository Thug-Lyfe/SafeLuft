                    <p>Everyone participated in everything</p>
                    <p>Alex and David worked mostly on dummy-airline with its database and API, and search AngularJS on the frontend</p>
                    <p>Marco worked mostly on Services with database and API, and IATA code converter, and admin pages on the frontend</p>
                    
                    <p>everyone should get full points cause even though some did more of specific parts, we all worked </p>
                    <p>equally hard, and if any of us had problems, the rest of the group helped sort it out.</p>

                <uib-accordion-group heading="XP Principles">
                    <p>Our webapp is based on Simple Design as one of the XP Practices</p>
                    <p>We can used both Code Standards and Refactoring</p>
                    <p>We have had Continuous System Integration and Collective Ownership with the help of GitHub</p>
                    <p>We always Tested First with the help of Postman before implementation</p>
                    <p>We used an absurd amount of Pair Programming</p>
                    <p>We also held daily scrum meetings</p>

                <uib-accordion-group heading="Freelancer Experience">
                    <p>As soon as we posted our outsourced material on the freelancer website requests were flowing in. We waited for 2 days before we decided on the freelancer, we would delegate our outsource material to.</p>
                    <h3>Things That Went Well</h3>
                    <p>The freelancer we ended up delegating our frontend to, was very friendly. He sent us multiple drafts of the frontend and he was very willing to take criticism and change it as we wanted him to. We are very happy with his final result, and he was always easy to get a hold of if we had any questions. He even offered us to ask him questions after we had gotten his final product, although we didn’t take him up on his offer.</p>
                    <h3>Things That Went Poorly</h3>
                    <p>Not everything was lollipops and rainbows when it came to our freelancer. For starters the freelancer we picked hadn’t read our problem description before wanting to do our work. Due to not having read the problem description, when we delegated the project to him he asked us if he could change his offer, not only increasing his price, but also increasing the time it would take him to complete the work. This was quite a nuisance as we did pick him because he was one of the cheapest and quickest. 
Another problem was the fact that our freelancer was from India causing troubles in communication time and time again. This would mean we often had to tell him to do certain things multiple times before he realized what we were asking for. 
The final product that we ended up receiving was great, however he did use some code and methods we didn’t recognize. This lead us to change some things around and a lot of time wasted trying to use what he gave us before we decided on just doing it our way. We were also forced to implement the html differently than what we are used to, due to the way his scripts worked.
</p>
                    <h3>Things We Can Improve Upon</h3>
                    <p>We don’t really know many ways we could improve this experience. The only real problem we noticed was that our problem description wasn’t very precise. This lead to our freelancer having some questions and adding things we actually didn’t want. Besides our lack of precision we felt that the experience went rather smoothly, we also rated our freelancer 5/5 (he did ask us to rate him many times).</p>
