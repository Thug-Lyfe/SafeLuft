            <p>j-unit and postman</p>
            <p>the j-unit tests require that you input 2 values from: <a href="http://www.nationalbanken.dk/_vti_bin/DN/DataService.svc/CurrencyRatesXML?lang=en">currencyRates</a></p>
            <p>j-unit tests include, a database test that checks the manually typped with the database</p>
            <p>a calculate test that uses the 2 manually typed values and calculates them and checks if the restcall gives the same</p>
            <p>a user test that creates a user, checks if that user exists, then deletes the user and checks if the user is removed from the database</p>

            <p>everyone participated in everything</p>
            <p>David did most of cvr-regestry, design, security</p>
            <p>Alex did most of the calculator, admin pages</p>
            <p>Marco did most of database, periodic automatic updates and j-unit tests</p>
            <p>everyone should get full points cause even though some did more of specific parts, we all worked </p>
            <p>equally hard, and if any of us had problems, the rest of the group helped sort it out.</p>
